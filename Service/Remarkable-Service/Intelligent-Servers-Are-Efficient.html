<h2>Intelligent Servers Are Efficient</h2>
<p>Efficiency is imperative to a successful service. More work can be done (and more money made) with less effort when it is done efficiently. The absence of efficiency can also seriously affect the comfort level of the guests, as well as cost both time and money for the server and the restaurant as a whole. Disorganization and frantic movements result in guests being made to feel just as stressed as their servers. An inefficient technique interrupts the flow of the meal and erodes the environment of trust that is essential to a relaxed dining experience. However, when guests see the server's work being done quickly, smoothly, and easily, they are put at ease. They do not feel that they have put the server through any "trouble".</p>
<p>The economy of motion is essential to a server's success. Efficiency means getting the same work done but with less effort and better results. A general rule for a fast-paced restaurant is "Full hands in, full hands out.‚Äù This should become a mantra for a professional server. There is almost always something to be taken to or removed from a table or a service station. The ability to prioritize orders and plan trips to the kitchen and service area saves steps. The economy of motion can be spent on better serving the customer. Careful attention to mise en place (having everything in its place), an intelligent economy of motion, and a cooperative attitude make the server's job easier to perform, and the resulting ease sends a strong signal to the guests that they are in good hands.</p>
