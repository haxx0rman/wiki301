<h2><span class="text-big">Positive Servers Create A Positive Environment</span></h2>
<p><span class="text-big">Working with positive people is a pleasure; they create an environment that is pleasant for everyone, including the guests, which increases morale overall. A professional server maintains a happy and positive attitude, even amid chaos. This mindset helps you to see solutions to a problem or situation and even permits you to see problems as opportunities to improve quality. Maintaining a positive attitude is also crucial for stress management. The dining room can be a fast-paced and challenging environment, physically as well as emotionally. A professional server needs to assess and understand each guest and what their expectations are while maintaining a positive attitude that reflects the restaurant's standards for service.</span></p>
