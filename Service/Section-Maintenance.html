<h1>Section Maintenance</h1>
<p><i>“I consider my section to be a representation of myself”</i></p>
<p>Your section is your domain and as such should be treated with care and respect. Some say being a server is like being an entrepreneur and your section is your business, you sell what the restaurant paid for and receive a healthy 20% commission on everything sold. Aside from your service, your section is one of the only things you have control over in the restaurant. If your section is neat and tidy or if it has been set up carelessly, it will reflect on the server in the eyes of the guest and colleagues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One should make certain that every detail of their station is prepared for a busy night and that their section is in optimal condition.</p>
<p>This includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring that chairs are clean and tidy</li>
  <li>Keeping salt shakers and pepper grinders filled to the brim each day as if they've never been used</li>
  <li>Leveling the table properly</li>
  <li>Settings are precisely placed in a neat and uniform manner</li>
  <li>Stocking all supplies and materials</li>
  <li>Keeping your area swept and tidy</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot have a flawless service without flawless sections and flawless stations.</p>
