<h2>Smooth Service Requires Effective Communication</h2>
<p>The heart of restaurant service comes down to communication. The art of communication consists of transmitting just the right amount of information exactly when it is needed. Remarkable servers know that effective communication is a two-way street and depends as much on listening as it does on speaking. When you listen to your guests and the questions they are asking, you will be able to provide the right answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guest asks: "What is in the spinach and goat cheese quiche?"</p>
<p>The server replies: "Spinach and goat cheese."</p>
<p>The preceding exchange is technically accurate, but hardly helpful, and certainly does not make the customer feel appreciated. The guest is not asking you to read the name of the dish. The guest wants to know something more than what is written on the menu. With that in mind, the exchange might go like this:</p>
<p>Guest asks: "What is in the spinach and goat cheese quiche?"</p>
<p>The server replies: "In addition to locally grown spinach and farmhouse-fresh goat cheese, the chef includes onions with a bit of pancetta baked in an egg-and-cream custard."</p>
<p>Remarkable servers adapt their communication styles to the situation and the guests to whom they are speaking. Some guests respond well to humor, some prefer more formality. Your tone is as important as the words you speak; you can use it to convey warmth, welcome, and sincerity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are talking to the kitchen staff and fellow servers, you should use the specific jargon that makes communication between professionals quick and effective, whether you need to ask about the timing of a dish, alert the kitchen to an upcoming rush of orders, or let the chef know about a special request from a guest. However, that same jargon is never appropriate or helpful when you communicate with your guests. You and the kitchen know that "86 chicken" means the kitchen has run out of chicken, but your guest probably will not understand. The type of establishment very often determines the form and style of conversation between servers and guests. Some of your guests may be looking for quiet or a private conversation, while others may prefer to chat a bit. Reading the table can tell the server which guests want to talk and ask questions about the restaurant and which prefer to be left alone. Communication takes other forms, as well. For example, uniforms make it easy for guests to locate a member of the service staff. Menus, both printed and spoken, tell the guest what is available to eat and drink. Signs on doors indicate restrooms and exits. Certain words and phrases (please; thank you; you're welcome: and pardon me) are essential to the vocabulary of food service personnel. Polite words and considerate actions indicate sincere regard for others' well-being, fellow employees as well as guests. Avoid referring to guests as "guys and saying "no problem responding to thank you.</p>
