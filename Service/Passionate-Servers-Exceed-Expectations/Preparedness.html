<h2>Preparedness&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The food-service hospitality industry is not a business for procrastinators. Always think ahead; it is the only sensible way to work. Have everything ready before service begins. Every free moment can be used to prepare for when you will have less time. Putting off work that can be done in advance, such as stocking side stands and folding napkins, usually means having to do it later when time should be spent on the customer. Having all required equipment on hand (a corkscrew, an ah-so, matches or a lighter, an extra pencil or pen, or a small flashlight to aid in reading the menu in dim light) helps to make service personnel more useful and more professional in the eyes of the guest.</p>
