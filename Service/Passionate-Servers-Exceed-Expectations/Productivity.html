<h2>Productivity&nbsp;</h2>
<p>While grace and showmanship contribute to the making of a successful front-of-the-house staff member, the ability to get the job done is no less important. The best combination of these traits is a balanced one. One should enjoy a certain amount of performing, particularly if doing table-side cookery. At the same time, a server must be a real worker-one who always remembers that excellent service is the first goal. Productivity refers not only to an individual's productivity; but to the entire team. When one server drops something, another server should pick it up (and then wash their hands). Accuracy in order helps the bartender and cooks be more productive and less wasteful. Assisting other service staff whenever possible makes the entire restaurant more productive.</p>
