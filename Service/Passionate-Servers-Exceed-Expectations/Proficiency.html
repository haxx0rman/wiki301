<h2>Proficiency&nbsp;</h2>
<p>To advance in one's career, the professional server must be willing to work constantly at the expansion of their technical skills, knowledge, and multitasking abilities. A skill is the development of proficiency in an art or craft and is improved by practice. Examples of serving skills that are acquired with practice are moving through crowds with a tray of beverages opening sparkling and still wines; properly decanting red wines, and executing elegant tableside preparations.</p>
