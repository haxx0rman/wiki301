<h2>Honesty&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Honesty is an important trait for anyone, particularly an individual who is dealing with the public. During a regular business day, each member of the dining room staff has innumerable opportunities to deceive both the restaurant and the guest. By being, and appearing to be, totally honest in all aspects of the day-to-day routine, the professional server permits the guests to let down their guard a little, thereby allowing them to fully enjoy the time spent in the establishment. Trust is also integral to the working environment, you need to be able to trust each other and be trustworthy to work well together.</p>
