<h2>Economy&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Professionals in any business are responsible for doing their share to keep costs down. Untold amounts of revenue disappear daily in food-service establishments through waste--the largest and most unnecessary expense in the industry. Common sense is an important key to the economy</p>
<p>in the food-service industry; a rational person does not deliberately destroy or dispose of someone else's personal or business property. The professional server avoids waste by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carefully handle and stack china and glassware.</li>
  <li>Use glass racks designed for that specific glass.</li>
  <li>Carry no more than can be handled safely (ask another server to assist you, or make two safe trips, rather than one risky trip).</li>
  <li>Be careful not to discard silverware with refuse or to put them in the dirty linen baskets.</li>
  <li>Avoid unnecessary soiling of linen.</li>
  <li>Place linens that were received in a soiled or damaged condition in a separate area so they can be returned to the linen company for credit.</li>
  <li>Serve standard-size portions (serve appropriate portions of items such as butter and cream to avoid waste, replenishing only if required).</li>
  <li>Make sure that all items served are included on the bill, especially coffee.</li>
  <li>Use the recommended amount and type of cleaning chemicals (not only is overuse wasteful, but it can damage the item being cleaned or worse, cause illness).</li>
</ul>
