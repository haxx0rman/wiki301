<h2>Welcoming&nbsp;</h2>
<p>"You only have one chance to make a first impression." This is the rallying cry for every quality-oriented service business. In the food-service business, guests make decisions within their first minute of contact with the restaurant. Thus, a good server never forgets this oft-quoted but still essential maxim. When guests are met by friendly, welcoming hosts, they are assured that they can relax and enjoy their meal. Good servers are attentive to the guestsâ€™ needs, not only with the dishes served but also with the dining environment.</p>
