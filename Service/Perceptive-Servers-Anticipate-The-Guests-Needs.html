<h2>Perceptive Servers Anticipate The Guests' Needs</h2>
<p>Remarkable servers anticipate the dining needs of the guests. This begins with the first point of contact, the reservation, and continues through the delivery of the check and a final farewell. If a guest has a reservation, the table must be ready for the guests at the time of their expected reservation; otherwise, it creates a negative impression and can dramatically influence a guest's overall experience. Providing the right items or services to the guest just before they are needed means that your guests never have to wait while you find a clean cup or brew more coffee. There are countless opportunities during service to anticipate the guests' needs. Here are a few examples that are expected:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have tables ready and set for guests before they arrive.</li>
  <li>Refill glasses or cups before they are less than half full.</li>
  <li>Set down the proper flatware for each dish before the food is served.</li>
  <li>Bring cream and sugar before pouring hot coffee.</li>
  <li>Have the check ready to present before the guests request it.</li>
</ul>
