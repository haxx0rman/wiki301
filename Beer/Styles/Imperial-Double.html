<p>“Imperial” is another term you’ll see on a lot of beer bottles. You might also see its sister term, “Double,” which is increasingly preferred, though they basically mean the same thing: “this beer is really strong,” brewed with twice the amount of hops and malt (sometimes more), resulting in more flavor and more alcohol generally.</p>
<p>The first “Imperial” beer was brewed, and brewed strong, for the nineteenth-century Russian Imperial Court, hence the name. And while that first Imperial was a stout, many types of beer can be “Imperialized”—there are Imperial IPAs, Imperial Pilsners, and Imperial Pale Ales. And while it’s probably wise to try the regular (as in non-Imperial) style of a beer first, the category can be a fun way to get a sense for flavor profiles turned way, way up.</p>
