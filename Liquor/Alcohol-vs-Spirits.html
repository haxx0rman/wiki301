<h2><strong>What's The Difference Between Alcohol and Spirits?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>All spirits are alcoholic, but not all alcoholic drinks are spirits, also referred to as hard liquor.</p>
<p>These drinks tend to have a higher alcohol content than other alcoholic beverages and are made via distillation. Working with a fermented liquid as a base, distillation essentially separates the drink by boiling and condensing it, increasing the alcohol content as a result. While modern distilleries use a little more complicated process than "just boil it," the process is still roughly the same.</p>
