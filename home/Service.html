<h1>Giving Remarkable Service</h1>
<p>Hospitality implies constant concern for the welfare and enjoyment of the guest. Every action you perform needs to come across as genuine. You can say all of the right words, but if you do not convey a certain warmth, your guests will feel a lack of sincerity. Hospitality is often the intangible aspect of our industry, and that can be the most challenging concept to create and maintain. A professional serverâ€™s people skills are critical to creating hospitality, especially since no two guests are the same. Each guest entering your establishment has different expectations, experiences, and desires, all of which you will be capable of adapting to in stride with the proper toolset. Specific actions on the server's part can lead to desired feelings and emotions</p>
<p>on the guest's part. These actions can be singled out, defined, described, and put</p>
<p>into simple, trainable terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anticipating the pace of a meal and bringing successive courses at just the right time and presetting necessary utensils</li>
  <li>Avoiding bare-handed contact with plates other than thumb knuckle on rim or glass rims</li>
  <li>Suggesting menu items that will complement dishes already ordered</li>
  <li>Presenting the check at the appropriate moment when the meal is done</li>
</ul>
<p>Hospitality depends on feelings and impressions, while the essence of service resides in actions. Service is being able to carry dinner plates without spilling the sauce, or opening a bottle of Champagne without losing some of the contents in a gush of foam. Though service tasks themselves do not involve emotion, they can evoke positive feelings in guests when they are carried out professionally.</p>
<p>A high level of caring for the comfort of guests - remarkable service in other words - is the distinctive attribute of the best dining establishments. Providing good service is the heart of all businesses. The more personalized the service, the more the guests will know they are being treated with respect and care. There are nine basic principles of service that are the foundation of a good server. It should come as no surprise that excellent service draws upon both the hospitality and service skills in the professional server's toolkit:</p>
