<p><strong>Beer</strong> is one of the oldest<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and most widely consumed<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_drink">alcoholic drinks</a> in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water">water</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea">tea</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> It is produced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing">brewing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(food)">fermentation</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch">starches</a>, mainly derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal">cereal</a> grainsâ€”most commonly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt">malted</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley">barley</a>, though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize">maize</a> (corn), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice">rice</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oats">oats</a> are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar">sugars</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort">wort</a> produces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol">ethanol</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonation">carbonation</a> in the resulting beer.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-Barth_2014-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Most modern beer is brewed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops">hops</a>, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preservative">preservative</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilizing_agent">stabilizing agent</a>. Other flavouring agents such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruit">gruit</a>, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-carbonated-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
<p>Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi">Code of Hammurabi</a> included laws regulating beer and beer parlours,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> and "The Hymn to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninkasi">Ninkasi</a>", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-Nin-kasi-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-sumer-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
<p>Beer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draught_beer">draught</a>, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation">multinational companies</a> and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbrewery#Brewpub">brewpubs</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_brewery">regional breweries</a>. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume">alcohol by volume</a> (ABV), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% ABV and above.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-BBC_News_2010-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>
<p>Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_festival">beer festivals</a>, as well as a rich <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub">pub</a> culture involving activities like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_crawl">pub crawling</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_quiz">pub quizzes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_games">pub games</a>.</p>
<p>When beer is distilled, the resulting liquor is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky">whisky</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer#cite_note-Pomranz_2016-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>
