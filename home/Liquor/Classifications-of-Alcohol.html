<h2><strong>What Are The Different Classifications of Alcoholic Drinks?</strong></h2>
<p>All alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, one of the only types of alcohol that isn't outright toxic to human beings. Of these beverages, there are four distinct classifications:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Distilled.&nbsp;</strong>Created by distilling fermented materials. There are multiple types of spirits, which we'll go into more detail below.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Fermented.&nbsp;</strong>As the name suggests, these are created via fermentation. Wine and beer are the most commonly known.</li>
  <li><strong>Fortified.&nbsp;</strong>Fermented beverages that have had spirits added either during or shortly after fermentation. Typically, this is only done with wine.</li>
  <li><strong>Liqueurs.&nbsp;</strong>Created by combining spirits with fruit, sugars, spices, and/or cream. This can be done in several ways, including infusion, maceration, and simple mixing.</li>
</ul>
