<h1><strong>Munich Helles Lager</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>ESSENTIAL INFO</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>COLOR:&nbsp;<br>Yellow to gold</li>
  <li>ABV:<br>4.5%-6%</li>
  <li>COMMERCIAL EXAMPLES:<br>Spaten Münchner Hell, Hofbräu Original, Weihenstephaner Original</li>
</ul>
<p>Developed by the Spaten brewery as a response to the popularity of the Czech Pilsner (in German, “helles” means “bright”), a Munich Helles is always going to be maltier than the Pilsner style. Whereas hops get center stage in a Pilsner, it’s actually the Pilsner malts that get center stage in a Munich Helles, with some grainy, malty sweetness that’s gently undercut by spicy, modestly bitter noble hops. A slightly higher alcohol content and smoother, more medium-bodied mouthfeel than a Pilsner.</p>
