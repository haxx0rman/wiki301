<p>You may look at a black lager in a pint glass and shout “stout!” or “porter!” And that’s a fair mistake, considering you can only tell so much from looking at a beer. But what differentiates a Black Lager from other dark beers, especially stouts and porters, is a relatively lighter body, with roasty dark notes from the malts stopping well short of any stout-level depth. Fewer fruity esters play in the roastiness since this is a lager-style beer. Instead, hops step in and provide an assertive but pleasant bitterness. Referred to as “Schwarzbier” in Germany (literally “black beer”) and American Black Lager in the U.S., it’s a good option for depth without as much body, dark and mysterious but still refreshing and quenchingly dry.</p>
