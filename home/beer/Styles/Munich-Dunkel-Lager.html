<p>A classic German beer style that originated in—you guessed it—Munich but has since spread in popularity, made with a large proportion of Munich malt. Unlike a Munich Helles, which came later, the Munich Dunkel is dark (“helles” means bright and “dunkel” means dark), with an emphasis on the rich flavors of the Munich malt (toast, nuttiness, toffee, bread, chocolate, molasses). Noble hops can definitely peek through and subdue any residual sweetness, but malts are the hearty star of the show here.</p>
