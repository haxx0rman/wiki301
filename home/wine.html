<h1>Wine</h1>
<p>Wine can be a daunting subject at first glance. The world of wine is so complex and layered it is almost endless and some dedicate their lives to learning as much as they can and still have a long road ahead of them. Wine may be intimidating but it is an incredibly rewarding subject of study. Being able to choose the perfect wine for your guests and seeing the effect that it can have is gratifying. Not to mention the benefits of being able to find a wine that you truly enjoy yourself, or being able to pick an enjoyable wine for date night without being intimidated by the wine list.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Wine?</strong></h2>
<p>For thousands of years, humans have been turning the juices of grapes into wine. Today wine is more popular than ever. Wine can be defined in many different ways depending on how it is used. We use wine to celebrate, to add to the enjoyment of food, and to foster conversation. Some collect and store wines, waiting for the perfect moment to remove the cork. Wine is intertwined throughout the history of mankind, and continues to be an important part of daily life and custom in many parts of the world today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two things need to e understood for wine to make sense: the raw material used for production and the process by which its produced.</p>
<h2>Fruit: the Raw Material of Wine</h2>
<p>The sugar found in grapes is the raw material used to produce wine, and technically wine can be produced from any fruit that contains sugar, not just grapes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fermentation: How Wine is Produced</h2>
<p>Regardless of the beverage being produced, all alcoholic beverages must go through fermentation. This process is the only way that humans can produce alcohol for consumption. Alcoholic fermentation is a biological process that occurs in nature every day. In fact, it is an initial stage of the spoilage process, as a microorganism breaks a compound down into smaller parts during this type of fermentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sugar + yeast = Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide + Heat</p>
<p>When yeast comes in contact with sugar, it consumes the sugar molecules, breaking them down into two major waste products: ethanol and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Practically any source of sugar can be fermented. The type of sugar that goes through fermentation determines what type of beverage is being produced. &nbsp;We typically describe wines based on the actual varietal of grape used to produce them. A varietal is the particular subspecies or type of grape. Since the grape is the sugar source, its characteristics are carried over into the finished wine after fermentation.</p>
<p>Yeast is a single-celled fungus that feeds on carbohydrates. A specific species of yeast is used to conduct most alcoholic fermentations. The scientific name for this species is Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Wine is a seemingly simple beverage that becomes more complex the more you study it. The good thing is, it doesnâ€™t matter how much you know, nearly everyone can appreciate wine. In short, wine is good.</p>
