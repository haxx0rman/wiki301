<h2>Genuine Servers Promote Trust And Confidence</h2>
<p>Restaurants, like people, have reputations. A good reputation grows from the trust and confidence that guests feel. If you are known for treating guests honestly and with respect, everyone benefits. You want your guest to trust that the dishes on the menu are fairly and accurately described, that the kitchen cooked the food properly and safely, that the glassware and china were properly washed, and that the decaffeinated coffee he or she ordered is, in fact, decaffeinated. Since it is very easy to lose the guest's trust, you should make every effort to meet expectations. One significant area of trust concerns food allergies. Your guests with food allergies depend on you to know what is in each dish, as well as to know what can be changed and what cannot. You, as the server, have to trust that your guest will tell you about any known allergy so that you can offer the appropriate assistance. Dealing with guests straightforwardly and honestly puts them at ease. When they are relaxed, they are happy. When they are happy, they order more freely and they tip more generously. Trust enhances the dining experience for everyone. The front of the house is not a place for employees to indulge in unrestrained chatting. Service personnel should only speak concerning business, limiting their conversations with fellow workers to the job at hand. Using a foreign language while speaking with other employees might give the guests the impression you are talking about them. Service staff should always speak in the language normally used in the restaurant's location, although the ability to converse in the language of the guests (or one appropriate to the cuisine of the restaurant) is an asset. Unless the customer initiates a conversation, the only subjects of discussion with guests should be the meal and its service. Speak in a clear voice with pleasant intonation, and never be loud. A good server is unobtrusive.</p>
