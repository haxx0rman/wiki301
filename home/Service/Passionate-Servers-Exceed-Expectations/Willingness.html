<h2>Willingness&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A willing server routinely does more than is expected- helping coworkers, carrying an umbrella for guests as they walk back to their car, and volunteering valuable feedback to management without being asked. Remarkable service exceeds expectations. Good servers cultivate these behavioral traits, recognizing them as the essential tools of their trade. Good servers also know that they do not work alone; they are part of a team, which is an integrated staff of restaurant personnel. Hospitality without service skills to back it up is nothing more than a series of platitudes and pleasantries. Service without hospitality is impersonal and cold. When you use service skills to deliver on the promise of hospitality and hospitality skills to make service personal, you are practicing remarkable service. A musician studies the notes and chords on the page and develops the skills necessary to play them. But the sounds are not music until the musician puts some passion into playing the notes. The same is true for serving. The skills of serving do not qualify as hospitality without a sincere desire to provide a pleasant experience for the guests. And remember, if a guest has to ask for more of something: more water, more butter, bread, wine, another cocktail, or something that should have been provided before the food was served; a soup spoon, the side dish they ordered, it is a sign that you are not doing your job.</p>
