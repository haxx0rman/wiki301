<h2>Politeness&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The professional server must do more than anticipate the food and beverage needs of the guest. The professional server should be happy to assist in any area that relates to the customer's comfort. This includes such tasks as opening doors; helping guests with chairs, packages, coats, and dropped items; correcting glare from lights or the sun; eliminating drafts; and adjusting the sound level of music, if necessary. When a guest asks for directions (i.e., to the bar, coatroom, or restroom) it is both rude and insufficient to point. A professional server should offer to show the guest the way, personally. The guest may prefer simple directions, but one should never assume that to be the case.</p>
