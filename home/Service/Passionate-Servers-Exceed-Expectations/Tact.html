<h2>Tact&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The ability to say or do the right thing at the right time without offense to others is important for anyone dealing with the public. The professional server takes care in correcting a misinformed guest and always steers the conversation into safe, agreeable channels. You should also be prepared for guests that will put you on the spot about sensitive subjects. It is important not to disagree or argue with your guest and instead try to look for some common ground, steer the conversation in that direction, and try to conclude it as quickly as possible. Topics such as religion, sexuality, politics, etc. should be avoided.</p>
