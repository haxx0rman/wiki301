<h2>Attentiveness&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Professional servers do not daydream at work, nor are they absentminded. They must always be alert to the needs of the guests. No guest should ever have to work to attract a service person's attention. The station must never be left unattended. The ability to recognize the current state of the dining room while keeping track of what is about to occur calls for more skill than most realize. At all times the professional server must have an ongoing knowledge of what is happening at each of the tables. This is accomplished by reading the table. It is necessary to keep a discreet watch on the diners' progress throughout their meals. Anticipating when more wine should be poured, when the table needs to be cleared, and how orders should be coordinated requires that one's attention stay on the job at hand. A server's eyes should constantly be surveying the tabletop with the five areas of table maintenance in mind and glancing at the guestsâ€™ eyes, in case they have a request.</p>
