<h2>Knowledge&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The professional server must be prepared to answer any questions asked by guests and to do so without continually making inquiries of busy fellow employees. A good server is a good salesperson, and good salespeople always know their product line. A good server would never ask a chef to leave something off a plate that was never there in the first place. It is essential for the server to take the time to become familiar with the menu and beverage list, to know their ingredients, their preparation time, their proper service temperature, and their garnishes. This information can help deal with special requests, such as substitutions for, or allergies to, certain ingredients. Awareness of the physical features of the dining room and kitchen can help the server speedily solve any problems that arise. The professional server's knowledge of the establishment's special services, hours of operation, history, and background, and special facilities can be a real help to new customers and, consequently, is good for business. Community news, future and current events in the region, and local places of interest are all topics on which the professional server should be informed. By reading books and periodicals about wines and foods, the professional server becomes more knowledgeable, and thereby reassuring in discussions with guests, and learns to appreciate the complexities of the culinary field. Winning the confidence of guests by being knowledgeable generates goodwill and increases tips. The successful server takes the time, on and off the job, to work at being well informed by attending wine tastings and cooking demonstrations or by taking service classes.&nbsp;</p>
