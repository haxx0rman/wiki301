<h2>Sensitivity&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The server must be sensitive to the needs of the guest, and adjust the pace of the meal accordingly. For many guests, a meal is a time to linger, engage in conversation, and eat slowly. For others, particularly at breakfast or lunch, a meal is only an interruption in a series of other events and not an event in itself. Even the devoted gastronome occasionally has a train to catch or a theater engagement scheduled immediately after mealtime. It is important to be sensitive to the guest's desire for quick, efficient service in these cases. While the customer should never be rushed, the professional server can expedite the meal in pleasant ways, such as suggesting menu items with minimal preparation times that enable speedy service. Waiters should know how long each dish on the menu takes to cook and use that information when the guest is ordering. This same knowledge can come in handy when a guest sends back a dish that he or she did not like, and the waiter needs to offer a replacement.</p>
<p>Empathy is also one of the most important tools of a good server. Being able to read the moods of guests and put yourself in their position can help you provide the best possible service. It is also important to keep in mind that you can never know what is happening in a guest or co-workerâ€™s life and it is important to be open-minded and compassionate about what they may be going through. This can be especially helpful at tables. Keep in mind that you could be in the unique position to turn a bad day into a great day by providing a relaxing escape from the trials of day-to-day responsibilities. If you accomplish this it will be returned with a wave of gratitude from the guest and almost certainly ensure a repeat visit.</p>
