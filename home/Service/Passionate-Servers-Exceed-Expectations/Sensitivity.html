<h2>Sensitivity&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The server must be sensitive to the needs of the guest, and adjust the pace of the meal accordingly. For many guests, a meal is a time to linger, engage in conversation, and eat slowly. For others, particularly at breakfast or lunch, a meal is only an interruption in a series of other events and not an event in itself. Even the devoted gastronome occasionally has a train to catch or a theater engagement scheduled immediately after mealtime. It is important to be sensitive to the guest's desire for quick, efficient service in these cases. While the customer should never be rushed, the professional server can expedite the meal in pleasant ways, such as suggesting menu items with minimal preparation times that enable speedy service. Waiters should know how long each dish on the menu takes to cook and use that information when the guest is ordering. This same knowledge can come in handy when a guest sends back a dish that he or she did not like, and the waiter needs to offer a replacement.</p>
