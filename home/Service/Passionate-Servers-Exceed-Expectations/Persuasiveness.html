<h2>Persuasiveness&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Even before the actual service of the meal begins the professional server must "sell‚Äù the guest on what to order. Selling increases the check average. This, in turn, increases the restaurant's profits and gratuities, as well. Subtly, a good server will steer guests away from choosing certain menu items (if the circumstances are appropriate) and induce them to order others. Incremental sales in areas such as drink specials shared appetizers, or desserts not only enhance the guest's experience, they can increase the check average, thus increasing gratuities as well. As the guests enter the dining room, the professional server can begin to determine whether to try selling them expensive items or extras or whether to suggest items that are more of a bargain. It helps to be able to sense whether the guests are likely to want a simply prepared, standard dish or a more elaborate and unusual one. Guests may not be familiar with all of the menu items or how they may be combined for maximum enjoyment. Therefore, the server is uniquely qualified to increase the guests' pleasure throughout their dining experience. If done properly, the guests will appreciate this form of selling.</p>
