<h2>Loyalty&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Professional servers make an effort to obey regulations and behave positively toward the firm for which they are working. Loyalty is also demonstrated by maintaining high standards of quality. Part of loyalty is a sense of proprietorship-of belonging to, and ownership of, one's job. Professional servers who see themselves as proprietors of their business work together for the common good, helping their fellow employees to consistently achieve the highest standards of service. Loyalty to the guest is also important to the development of repeat business. Servers must never blame the kitchen for delays. The servers and the kitchen staff are both working to achieve the same goal: pleasing the guests. The server is the most visible representative of a unified effort to provide good service to the guest. Showing loyalty to, and working together with, all of the restaurant's staff presents the restaurant as a competent and confident entity dedicated to providing remarkable service to the guests.&nbsp;</p>
