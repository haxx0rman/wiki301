<h2>Dedicated Servers Are Knowledgeable</h2>
<p>Servers must be knowledgeable about the menu they are serving to the guest. You should be able to do the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pronounce the name of each dish and describe it accurately.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Describe portion sizes.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Describe special flavors or textures in a dish.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Identify any potential allergens in foods.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Identify dishes that can be modified, as well as those that cannot, in case guests wish to make modifications or substitutions.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Assist guests who are concerned about too much or too little food to make appropriate selections.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Point out the specialties of the house or the region.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Have a fun fact or story about as many items as you can, this will increase intrigue in the product and give you the appearance of being a more knowledgeable and passionate server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond knowing the menus (including tasting, specials, beverage, wine, and cocktail menus), you are also the source for information about the restaurant itself, chef and owner's names including locations of restrooms, PDRs, and designated smoking areas. You should be able to let guests know about special promotions or special events that will be happening at your establishment or in the community. Guests who are new to the area may want to know about special attractions or other points of interest.</p>
