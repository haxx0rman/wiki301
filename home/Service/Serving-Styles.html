<h1>Serving Styles</h1>
<p>Serving is an old tradition and like any old practice, there are many ways of doing it correctly depending on the situation, culture, and what is being served.</p>
<h2>French Service</h2>
<p>Today's formal service style has its roots in French Service.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Russian, or Platter, Service</h2>
<p>Russian service assured that each guest's meal was served at its best. The burden of assuring the guest's enjoyment was shifted to the host (or the host's staff) while attracting as little attention as possible. Food was served hot from the kitchen, in individual portions, rather than an immense display where all the dishes, prepared well ahead of time, had been sitting for maximum visual effect.</p>
