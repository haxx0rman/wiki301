<h1>Serving Styles</h1>
<p>Serving is an old tradition and like any old practice, there are many ways of doing it correctly depending on the situation, culture, and what is being served.</p>
<h2>French Service</h2>
<p>Today's formal service style has its roots in French Service. As guests entered the dining room the first course was already set up. The origin of the word entr√©e for the first course can be traced to this entering the dining room. After the guests finished a service they got up and left the table while it was cleaned and reset for the next service. Service was family style. today formal French service generally requires a captain to seat guests and take orders, a sommelier to assist in wine selection and serve the wine, a front, and back waiter to prepare and deliver the food, and a busser to bring water and bread.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Russian, or Platter, Service</h2>
<p>Russian service assured that each guest's meal was served at its best. The burden of assuring the guest's enjoyment was shifted to the host (or the host's staff) while attracting as little attention as possible. Food was served hot from the kitchen, in individual portions, rather than an immense display where all the dishes, prepared well ahead of time, had been sitting for a maximum visual effect like the French. There are varying opinions on the definitions of French and Russian service. The common thought is that tableside cooking is the fanciest, and therefore, must be French. However French service was actually family style until 1810 when a Russian diplomat hosted a dinner party and introduced tableside carving and pre-plated dishes that were common in Russia. The French were so impressed with the hot food that they slowly adopted the style and expanded on the possibilities of tableside service preparation. Russian service is mostly used for banquets today.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>American Service</h2>
<p>Among the least formal styles of service, and by far the most widespread, American service is adaptable to a wide range of restaurant types and cuisine styles, ranging from bistros and trattorias to fine dining establishments. In American service, all cooking and plating of food are done in the kitchen, which gives the chef greater control over each dish. A waiter or food runner picks up the plated food, carries it to the dining room, and sets down the plates in front of the guests from the right with the right hand. This allows two or three plates to be held in the left hand and arm while serving from the right. American service is usually employed in fast turnover, high-volume operations. It can be used in more stylish types of dining operations with procedures varying depending on the service needs. Some chefs prefer American service because plating the food in the kitchen allows them to showcase their creativity in food presentations.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>House Style</h2>
<p>The main points of good service, regardless of style, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All foods are served at their appropriate temperatures, hot foods are served hot on warm plates, and cold food is served cold on cold plates.</li>
  <li>All foods and beverages are served in a timely, courteous, sanitary manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>The techniques a restaurant may use in order to achieve the two main goals of good service are based on variations of the classic styles, adjusted and adapted to suit the style of the restaurant. The way any establishment goes about achieving these points can vary dramatically, depending on the type of service that is practiced in the establishment--in other words, the restaurant's house style. The kind of food to be served is an important deciding factor, but it is not the only one. Certainly, the price range, ambiance of the room, and demographics of the market one wish to attract must be considered.</p>
