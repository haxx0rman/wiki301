<h2>Passionate Servers Exceed Expectations</h2>
<p>Exceeding expectations does not need to be time-consuming and costly. The challenge is determining what the guests are expecting, and going above and beyond that. While repeat customers expect the same level of service each time they visit, they will be less impressed each time. This may seem unfair, but it's a fact of human nature. What is exceptional today will be expected tomorrow, and be barely adequate the day after tomorrow. Remarkable servers are constantly seeking ways to better their performance-finding new ways to delight the guests through the use of the principles already discussed, and incorporating them into this last principle: The best service is constantly improving service.</p>
<p>If a single word were to describe the sum of personal characteristics that define a professional server, it would be 'caring'. Every task, no matter how small, is carried out for one reason: to make the guest's stay as pleasant as possible. To succeed in this pursuit, a professional server must have certain characteristics, both physical (professional appearance and good personal hygiene) and behavioral (appropriate personality traits). The most important behavioral characteristic a truly professional server can possess is the ability to deal with people. No amount of polish or knowledge can replace sincere concern for the customer's enjoyment of their dining experience. Maintaining a high level of this personal concern is not always easy. Most servers are familiar with cranky, demanding restaurant customers who aggravate service personnel while expecting them to be pleasant and efficient in return. Everyone has bad days occasionally, but professional servers should never let this be observed by the guests. It is important to remember that if you can see the guests, the guests can see you. In addition to being adept with the public, a person in the front of the house must have characteristics possessed by any individual of integrity, particularly as they relate to conducting business.</p>
