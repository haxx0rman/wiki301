<h2>Effective Servers Are Adaptable</h2>
<p>Each restaurant has its standards for the specific actions that go into remarkable service. For instance, it is a common standard that you should stand just behind and to the right of the guest and then set down the plate from the guest's right with your right hand. However, you may often find yourself needing to bend that rule in the interest of the guests' dining experience or common sense. You cannot stand behind guests seated at a banquet, and you should not interrupt a conversation, but you can and should make an effort to serve the food in such a way that you do not show the guest the back of your hand, and serve open-handed. Several other situations call for flexibility. One guest may want an appetizer for the main course with a salad to follow, while everyone else orders an appetizer followed by a salad and then the main course. Your restaurant may serve bread only after the order has been taken, but your guests might ask for it when they first sit down. There are no specific rules for these situations. Instead, the best practice is to consider what you would like if the roles of server and guest were reversed.</p>
