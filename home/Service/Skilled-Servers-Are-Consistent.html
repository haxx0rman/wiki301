<h2>Skilled Servers Are Consistent</h2>
<p>Guests visit a restaurant for the first time for various reasons. They come back for only one: they like the restaurant, including its food and its service. Making good use of all of the principles of hospitality and service can persuade a guest to come back to the restaurant, and the consistent delivery of high-quality food and service will encourage repeat business. The key to achieving long-term success is the consistent delivery of the best possible service to every guest every day, every week every month, and every year. Reliability is the foundation needed to create repeat guests and build a strong, positive reputation for your establishment.</p>
